## App descrption

The goal of the app is to make typing easier and faster for users by **predicting** the
next words the user is going to input following what the user has already typed. 

### Limitations:
Since the model builds on a great deal of data (~4.4million), the computation time it takes to form a prediction is long. So instead of using the entire dataset, a random sample of it is used. This can reduce computation time at the cost of some accuracy.

### Try it out!

## App basic function
The app takes single word or phrases as input

## App secondary function
User can also view information about the dataset used to build the model:

- top 10 bigrams
- top 10 trigrams
- word cloud of top 100 words

## How does the prediction work?
1. A 30,000 sample of sentences taken from various sources(news, blogs, twitter).

2. The whole data set is stripped of punctuations and common stop words, and then broken down into pairs/triplets of words (bigrams/trigrams)

3. The model is built off the back-off model:
  - last two words are compared first to the trigram 
  - prediciton is picked as the third word of the trigram occuring at the highest frequency
  - if there are no matches, the last word of the input is compared to the bigram
  - prediction is then the second word of the bigram occuring at the highest frequency
